This is a simple server app using Express, Webpack, React, Babel, and more.
The purpose of it is to be a template for various projects.

Express: I like using this for routing with Node.js
Webpack: Good for bundling all my scripts into a single file
Babel: I've found ES6 (and beyond) features to be very helpful and convenient with JavaScript
React: Great for making web apps and working with the DOM.
